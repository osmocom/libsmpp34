libsmpp34 - C library for SMPP 3.4
==================================

This repository contains a C-language library implementing the SMPP
Protocol version 3.4 as specified by the SMPP Developers Forum.

The library was inherited from the
[c-open-smmp34](https://sourceforge.net/projects/c-open-smpp-34/)
project, which unfortunately doesn't have any form of revision control
system and hence the [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) Open Source
Mobile Communications project has imported the v1.10 release into this
git repository and performed subsequent improvements.
